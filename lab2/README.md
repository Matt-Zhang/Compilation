#Lab2

Type `make parser` to compile the **parser**.

If syntax error occurs, it is inevitable that the parser has segment faults.

For the error type 15, in the requirement it is said to only deal with both initial and redefined problems whereas in the example, the error suggestion only shows the redefined one so I add the init suggestion.

Although the parser has went through some basic tests, in some special cases there will also be something wrong. If any problem occurs, please contact mattzhang9@gmail.com.
